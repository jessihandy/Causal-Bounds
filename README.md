Template files for you to perform your own analyses are included here.
- functions.R stores the underlying functions. 
- data.R generates a fake dataset to emulate both a joint and non-joint datasetting. Refer to this code for insights on how to format your own data to run the associated template script. 
- template.R runs the established functions on the fake dataset to generate the causal risks and associated bounds described in the paper. Reformat this script to pull from your own datasetting to generate bounds in your analyses.
